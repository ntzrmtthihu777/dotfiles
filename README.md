# i3wm config
**This config currently has my resolution (for a compton trick), direct path to my wallpaper and other such things in it. These need to be edited before use!**

Uses:
* [termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite) as terminal emulator
* [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) as compositor
* [Inconsolata](https://github.com/chjj/compton) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) as fonts
* [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) as colour palette

* [Lock script](http://plankenau.com/blog/post-10/gaussianlock)
* [Power management menu](https://faq.i3wm.org/question/239/how-do-i-suspendlockscreen-and-logout/?answer=1927#post-id-1927)
